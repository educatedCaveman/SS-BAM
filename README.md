Sling-Shot Band Ammo Matching

## About

The purpose of this repository is to store all the data files, writeups and code used to test the following hypothesis:

> When shooting a slingshot, it is best to match the ammo to the band, and vice versa.

The general plan for testing this is to obtain a variety of bands and ammo, and measure the resulting shot speed. By measuring the forces, masses, and velocities involved, I should be able to extrapolate the kinetic energy of the shots, the potential energy of the bands before the shots, and possibly determine the energy efficiency of the various combinations. I also intend to create graphs/plots of the resulting data in order better digest the results.
